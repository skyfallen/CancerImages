Study project at Lviv Data Science Summer School 

Predicting ratio of cancerous cells in breast tissue images

Domain: Bioinformatics, Deep learning

We are going to apply state of the art machine learning and image processing methods for distinguishing between cancerous and normal cells based on images of breast tissue. The ultimate goal of the project is to predict a ratio of cancerous cells to normal cells and compare it to doctors estimates.
